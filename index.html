<p>
Welcome to the Student Inc. Webpage. You might me wondering why are we claiming that "We are the best"?,
So, if you don't know we are a compueter selling company, we collect orders online and deliver the computer 
to the costumer's house, at a very cheap and the best price in the market.This company was invented in early 2000's by two friends
who wanted to provide the best information of computers to perople and mainly to students, to guide them which device will help them for their studies,
because they got difficulties in their school time with such things. so they wanted to help students for their studies and
other people regarding their requirememts.
